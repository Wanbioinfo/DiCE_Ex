# DiCE-Ex (DiCE-Ex)

**DiCE-Ex** is an interactive web server implementing the **Differential Centrality-Ensemble (DiCE)** framework for network-based gene discovery from transcriptomic data. The platform enables researchers to identify influential disease-associated genes by integrating differential expression, information-theoretic feature selection, and protein–protein interaction (PPI) network topology—without relying on prior disease annotations.

## Background

Traditional differential gene expression (DGE) analysis often misses biologically important genes with subtle expression changes. Network-based approaches help address this limitation but frequently depend on prior disease knowledge.

**DiCE (Differential Centrality-Ensemble analysis)** overcomes these challenges by:
- Integrating expression-driven gene selection with network topology
- Constructing condition-specific weighted PPI networks
- Ranking genes based on changes in network influence

DiCE-Ex provides a complete, user-friendly interface to perform this analysis directly from transcriptomic data.

## Input Requirements

### 1. Normalized Expression Matrix
- File formats: `.csv`, `.tsv`, `.xlsx`, `.rds`
- Genes as **columns**
- Samples as **rows**
- **Class/condition label must be in the LAST column**
- Do **not** place sample names as the first column

### 2. Differential Gene Expression (DGE) Results
Must include the following columns:
- Gene identifier (official gene symbols recommended)
- `logFC`
- `P.Value`
- `adj.P.Val`

### 3. Experimental Design
- Two-group comparison (e.g., Tumor vs Normal)
- Group labels must exactly match values in the class column (case-sensitive)

## Supported Species

- **Human (Homo sapiens)**
- **Mouse (Mus musculus)**

---

## Output

- DiCE results containing all genes retained across DiCE phases, along with differential expression metrics, IG or Weighted IG scores, network centrality values for each condition, and final ensemble ranks.
- Detected PPI modules and membership tables: Detected modules in the STRING-derived interaction network of DiCE genes represent groups of tightly connected genes that may correspond to shared biological processes or pathways.
- Interactive results visualization and exploration
- Downloadable result files (Excel)
